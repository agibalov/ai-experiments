# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Goal is to predict outcomes for new data
- Examples: Classification, Regression

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Works with unlabeled data
- Finds hidden patterns in data
- Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through interaction with environment
- Uses rewards and penalties
- Examples: Game playing, Robotics

## Common Algorithms

### Linear Regression
- Predicts continuous values
- Finds best line through data points
- Simple but effective for many problems

### Decision Trees
- Creates tree-like model of decisions
- Easy to interpret and visualize
- Can handle both numerical and categorical data

### Neural Networks
- Inspired by biological neurons
- Can learn complex patterns
- Foundation of deep learning

## Key Concepts

- **Training Data**: Data used to teach the algorithm
- **Features**: Input variables used to make predictions
- **Model**: The algorithm that makes predictions
- **Accuracy**: Measure of how often predictions are correct
- **Overfitting**: When model works well on training data but poorly on new data

## Popular Libraries

- **Scikit-learn**: General-purpose ML library
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework by Google
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework by Facebook
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
