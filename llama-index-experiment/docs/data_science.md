# Data Science Workflow

## Overview

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, programming, and domain expertise to extract insights from data.

## The Data Science Process

### 1. Problem Definition
- Clearly define the business problem
- Determine what questions need to be answered
- Set success criteria and metrics

### 2. Data Collection
- Gather relevant data from various sources
- Consider data quality and completeness
- Ensure data privacy and compliance

### 3. Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Examine data structure and content
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Perform data validation and quality checks

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Create new features from existing data
- Select most relevant features
- Transform data into suitable formats

### 5. Model Development
- Choose appropriate algorithms
- Train models on training data
- Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Test models on validation data
- Use appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)
- Compare different model approaches

### 7. Deployment and Monitoring
- Deploy models to production environment
- Monitor model performance over time
- Update models as needed
