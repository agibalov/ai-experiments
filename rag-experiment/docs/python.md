* **Multi-paradigm**: Supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles.
* **Community-driven**: Strong open-source community, continuous updates (latest major is Python 3.x).

### Common Uses

* **Web development** (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
* **Data science & ML/AI** (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow)
* **Automation & scripting**
* **APIs & backend systems**
* **Game development** (Pygame, Godot bindings)

Would you like me to make you a **short “cheat sheet” style Markdown file** (with syntax, common data types, control flow, and examples) that you could actually use as a mini knowledge base for experiments?
