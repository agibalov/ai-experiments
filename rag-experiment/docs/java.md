### Key points:

* **Created by:** Sun Microsystems (1995), now maintained by Oracle.
* **Motto:** *‚ÄúWrite once, run anywhere‚Äù* ‚Äî thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), code compiled to bytecode can run on any system with a JVM (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.).
* **Use cases:** Web applications, enterprise software, Android apps, desktop apps, big data systems, backend services.
* **Features:**

  * Strongly typed, class-based, object-oriented.
  * Automatic memory management (garbage collection).
  * Large standard library (networking, collections, concurrency, etc.).
