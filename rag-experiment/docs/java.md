Java is a **general-purpose, object-oriented programming language** and also the **runtime platform** that executes programs written in it.

### Key points:

* **Created by:** Sun Microsystems (1995), now maintained by Oracle.
* **Motto:** *“Write once, run anywhere”* — thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), code compiled to bytecode can run on any system with a JVM (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.).
* **Use cases:** Web applications, enterprise software, Android apps, desktop apps, big data systems, backend services.
* **Features:**

  * Strongly typed, class-based, object-oriented.
  * Automatic memory management (garbage collection).
  * Large standard library (networking, collections, concurrency, etc.).
  * Huge ecosystem of frameworks (Spring, Hibernate, etc.).

👉 In short: **Java is both a programming language and a platform** used to build portable, scalable applications.

Would you like me to show you a **tiny Java code example** (like “Hello, world”)?
